# Cappuu + Solana

[Cappuu](cappuu.com) is a crypto wallet app for you to purchase USDC and invest DeFi without the gas fee. It's the simplest way for normal people to invest DeFi. Our goal is to support USDC on Solana so you can benefit from cheap transaction costs and invest DeFi on Ehereum to earn high yields. Cappuu is closed source so we can't provide the integration code of Solana in Cappuu. We open the code snippets that we use to integrate with Solana here to demonstrate how we implement this idea.
